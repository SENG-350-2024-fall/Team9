| **Use Case Identifier and Reference Number**| 1. Register for Ideal Spot on Virtual Waitlist                                                           |
| **Modification History**                    |  created 09/12/2024 - created for registration feature based on ED capacity and search radius.           |
| **Description**                             | This use case allows patients to register for a spot on the virtual waitlist at a nearby ED based on current capacity and desired search radius. The system returns available EDs and lets the patient choose the ideal one. This helps optimize patient flow and reduce overcrowding in EDs.                                  |
| **Actors**                                  | - **Patient**: Person seeking medical attention.<br> - **System (Mister Ed)**: Medical Information System facilitating registration and queue management.                                                                |
| **Assumptions**                             | - The patient has access to a mobile device or computer with Mister ED.<br> - EDs have up-to-date information on capacity and wait times.                                  |
| **Steps**                                   | 1. The patient opens Mister Ed and selects the "Find ED" option.<br> 2. The patient specifies a desired search radius (e.g., 5km, 10km).<br> 3. The system returns a list of nearby EDs within the radius, displaying their current capacity and estimated wait times.<br> 4. The patient reviews the options and selects the ED they prefer based on wait times, proximity, or other preferences.<br> 5. The patient registers for the waitlist at the selected ED.<br> 6. The system confirms the registration and provides the patient with an estimated time for their appointment or further instructions.                                  |
| **Variations (Optional)**                  | - If no EDs are available within the search radius, the system suggests increasing the radius or shows alternative care options.<br>.                                                               |
| **Non-Functional (Optional)**              | - The system must provide real-time ED capacity.<br> - The system must be accessible on mobile and web platforms with a user-friendly interface.                                           |
| **Issues**                                 | - Handling last-minute changes in ED capacity (e.g., sudden influx of emergency cases).<br> - Ensuring accurate and timely updates for ED wait times.
